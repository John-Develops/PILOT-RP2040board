# PILOT-RP2040board

The Pilot is a board I made around the RP2040 design example from Raspberry Pi. Unfortunate bit is, it only detects as a USB device and rejects all the UF2 files I have tried. This repo is meant to be like a log, where I will be updating the progress of getting this board back up and running.
