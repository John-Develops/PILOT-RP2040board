# PILOT-RP2040board

The Pilot is a board I made around the RP2040 design example from Raspberry Pi. Unfortunate bit is, it only detects as a USB device and rejects all the UF2 files I have tried. This repo is meant to be like a log, where I will be updating the progress of getting this board back up and running.

#Pilot V2

1-4-24 | 
PILOT V1 is now a success as of last year. There was an issue with a via that was being shorted to ground instead of 3 volts. | 
PILOT V2 is now on the way. It has a slimmer factor, one female GPIO header, an onboard gyroscope utilizing the MPU6050 chip, an onboard led for quick testing of the "blink" script, reversible USB-C, battery charging, a JST connector for a battery, and other improvements like a BOOT and RESET switch.
